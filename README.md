Scytale
=======

Scytale is a simple passkey protected reference based note-taking application build for Android. It is built using localstorage, Knockout.js, Fries, and Cordova/Phonegap. 

You can download the app at [Phonegap Build](https://build.phonegap.com/apps/459138/share).

That is, if it worked! 
----------------------

Dunno why but the apk fails to parse. Working on it, but being a learning exercise that's probably as far as I'd go.
